# Simple Nameplates

Simple Nameplates makes it easier to see who is attacking you, who might, and who is worth talking to. It gives Blizzard’s nameplates clear, consistent colors and readable names, with optional roleplaying names and titles. It is for players who want a useful view of the people and creatures around them, especially during everyday play and roleplay. Choose it over Blizzard’s defaults for more control over colors and text, or over Plater when a few straightforward settings cover what you need.

## Features

- Color names and health bars by danger, friendliness, and NPC interaction.
- Choose which categories show health bars and which show names alone.
- Adjust fonts, text size, bar width, and name placement.
- Add a dark health-bar gradient to make white text easier to read.
- Dim background NPC names to make other names stand out.
- Display NPC service titles and optional threat percentages.
- Highlight interruptible casts with a solid, pulsing, or animated alert border.
- Use Total RP 3 names, titles, and out-of-character markers.
- Save appearance profiles and let each character choose its own.
- Start with editable Default and High Contrast profiles.

Simple Nameplates styles Blizzard’s existing nameplates. Health and cast progress, spell icons, and target behavior remain controlled by the game. Plater’s scripting tools suit players who want to build more specialized combat displays; Simple Nameplates focuses on colors, names, and a small set of display choices.

## Installation

Download the repository using **Code → Download ZIP**, extract it, and copy the inner `SimpleNameplates` folder—the one containing `SimpleNameplates.toc`—to:

```text
World of Warcraft/_retail_/Interface/AddOns/SimpleNameplates/
```

Start World of Warcraft and enable the addon at character selection. Simple Nameplates is for Retail WoW. Its required libraries are included; Plater and Details are not required.

On your first login, the addon may ask to enable the nameplate settings it needs. Choose **Apply and enable** to accept the listed changes, or **Disable styling** to leave it off. Disabling styling restores the settings changed by that setup.

## Using Simple Nameplates

Type `/snp` to open settings, or find **Simple Nameplates** under **Options → AddOns**.

| Page | What you can change |
| --- | --- |
| Profiles | Turn styling on or off; select, create, copy, rename, delete, or restore profiles |
| Text | Fonts, text size, bar width, names inside or above bars, threat display, and critter/companion name hiding |
| Colors | Category colors and health bars, background-name dimming, gradient strength, and cast-highlight color and activation |
| Highlight | Cast-highlight effect, border thickness and offset, animation timing, and previews |
| TRP3 | Roleplaying names, short and long titles, and OOC markers |
| About | Installed version, source, commands, and known limitations |

Changes apply immediately and are saved. Settings cannot be changed during combat; entering combat cancels unfinished edits. Completed changes are kept.

### Colors and health bars

The first matching category wins:

| Priority | Category | Default color |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Attacking me | Red |
| 2 | Hostile | Orange |
| 3 | Neutral | Yellow |
| 4 | Friendly | Blue |
| 5 | NPC – Interactive | Green |
| 6 | NPC – Background | Grey |

An enemy that is attacking you uses red even if it also offers an interaction. NPC – Interactive uses interaction information supplied by WoW; an NPC’s title alone does not put it in that category.

Each category has a **Health Bar** switch. Turn it off to show a colored name and title without a bar. Background NPCs use names alone by default. Names inside bars use white outlined text, with optional dimming for background NPCs.

Cast highlighting is off by default. Enable **Active** beside the cast-highlight color on **Colors**, then choose the effect on **Highlight**. Both pages show a preview; disabled previews are grey, dimmed, and still.

### Profiles

Profiles are shared across your account, and each character remembers its selection. **Create** starts with default settings; **Copy** duplicates the selected profile. Default can be edited and restored, but cannot be renamed or deleted. High Contrast can also be edited. **Restore bundled profiles** restores both presets without changing custom profiles.

Additional fonts are available through SharedMedia font packs or other font-providing addons.

### Total RP 3

TRP3 integration is optional and off by default. Enable **Display TRP3 profile information** on **TRP3**, then choose the fields you want: roleplaying name, short title, long title, or OOC marker. If a profile is unavailable, the normal WoW name is used. NPC service titles work without TRP3. Casts temporarily take the place of titles beneath the nameplate.

## Known limitations

Simple Nameplates can style only nameplates WoW makes available to addons. Some separate overhead names remain controlled by Blizzard, including nonattackable opposite-faction players in sanctuaries. Enabling more nameplate settings does not guarantee access to those names.

Threat percentages appear only when WoW supplies usable threat information. Detecting which player is attacking you in PvP is best effort.

Use one nameplate addon at a time. If you see competing colors or duplicate displays, disable other nameplate addons and reload the UI.
